### Briefly About Myself:

I have been studying front-end for 1 year. I have knowladge and can work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, framework React, Webpack, Figma.


I have been fond of development and everything related to programming for a long time. Earlier I tried to study and work in Android studio, develop android applications. I studied JAVA for a some period of time. I began to study everything related to the front – end, following advice and recommendations. I really enjoyed learning the JavaScript language, as it is universal and can be widely used in the development of various web applications, ranging from writing games, animating sites, to single web applications using the React framework. It is understandable and easy to learn.

I have no significant development experience, at the moment, except for my own projects, and now I am writing a game in native JS called "sea battle".
 
Homework for HTMLAcademy and Udemy courses. I like to gain new knowledge and develop in this area. I understand that it was too late to decide to do it seriously, and I do not have enough experience, but I have a desire to learn something new. Before that, I worked in the field of logistics and procurement, but I realized that there is nowhere to grow here, and I want something more. I want to do what I like and to enjoy what I do, to create something new. 

I would be grateful if you are interested in my resume and give me the opportunity to work in this area.


I have experience at work under own home projects. 

**Among them:**
1. slider on JS,HTML and CSS, in this slider you will find counter (which shows active slide and total amount of slides), also you can choose slides with the help of arrows and also with click on dots, also swipes are realized here (touch events), adapted for different devices;
2. the same slider on REACT(with the same functions); 
3. exchage currency converter US dollars - BYN;

### Code example:

**KATA from CODEWARS:** _Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative._

**Example:** _The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case._

```
function countBits(n) {
   let bin = n.toString(2);
   console.log(bin);
   let numm = bin.split('');
   let result = numm.map(parseFloat);
   let sum = 0;
   for(let i = 0; i < result.length; i++){
       sum +=result[i];
       }
   return sum;  
  };  
  countBits(567536737);
